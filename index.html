                I am an Assistant Professor at the <a class="in-text" href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, with appointments in the Biostatistics Division and Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation (IHPME) at the <a class="in-text" href="https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca" >Dalla Lana School of Public Health (DLSPH)</a> and <a class="in-text" href="https://ischool.utoronto.ca" >Faculty of Information (FoI)</a>. I am recently named the Canada Research Chair (Tier 2) for mobile health solutions. My research integrates mobile devices and interconnected systems to develop innovative methods for health monitoring and analysis. I am particularly passionate about fostering a healthy society by creating equitable applications that empower individuals to take charge of their health and well-being. Grounded in systems research, my work explores the intersection of Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing, Applied Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction.<br><br>

                Beyond my academic pursuits, I relish the simple yet exquisite things in life. Connecting with nature via birdwatching is my portal to wellness. Not a photographer, but I do pretend to be one with some passable shots. Check out my <a class="in-text" href="gallery.html">gallery</a>.

                I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a class="in-text" href="https://lass.cs.umass.edu" >Laboratory of Advanced Software Systems (LASS)</a>, <a class="in-text" href="https://www.umass.edu" >University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA,</a> where I continue broadening my dissertation work of developing device-agnostic sensing systems and behavioral analytics for health applications under the mentorship of

                The orientation of my research is as affirmative as it is critical in fulfilling the long-term vision <b>“toward revolutionary smart health – one which offers deep personalization to an individual’s health but integrates personal health to drive population and public health efforts.”</b> Grounded in Systems research, my investigations lie in the intersecting subfields of Applied Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. My research publications are in top-tier conferences such as ACM IMWUT(UbiComp), CHI, and CSCW. I received my Ph.D. in Information Systems at the Singapore Management University, School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore, advised by <a class="in-text" href="https://apollo.smu.edu.sg" >Rajesh Balan</a> and co-advised by <a class="in-text" href="http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html" >Youngki Lee</a> from the <a class="in-text" href="https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en/" >Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Seoul National University</a>. -->
